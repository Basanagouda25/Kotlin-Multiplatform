## 💡 Why Kotlin Multiplatform?  
Kotlin Multiplatform allows developers to write code once and use it across multiple platforms while keeping native performance and user experience.

- ♻️ **Share business logic** across Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop.  
- 🎨 **Keep native UI** for each platform while reducing code duplication.  
- ⚙️ **Modern tooling** and growing ecosystem supported by JetBrains.  
- 🚀 **Faster development** and easier code maintenance.  
- 🌍 **Cross-platform libraries** for networking, serialization, and more.
